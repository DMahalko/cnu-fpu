Useless notice
--------------
You can [not so] easily brick your device by loading incorrectly modified firmwares. Be careful with CNUxx-* files.


Usage
-----
Unpack main firmware .zip or .sbn archive. 
.sbn archives are actually .tar.gz with signature attached.
You can remove signature from tar.gz file, but most tar implementations will detect its header.
	unsign.pl <source_file> gz <source_file-unsigned>


1. Unsign firmware file you want to unpack:
	unsign.pl <source_file> cnu <source_file-unsigned>


2. Unpack unsigned firmware file contents to directory:
	fpu.pl --unpack --input-file=input_filename [--output-dir=some/dir] [--quiet]

Output dir is set to input_filename-unpacked by default

3. Do something with firmware

4. Pack directory contents into a firmware file:
	fpu.pl --pack --input-dir=some/dir --output-file=new_cool_firmware_file [--quiet]

5. Fire up your TFTP server and place modified firmware file there ;)

6. Reset your phone to force upgrade procedure. Reset method depends on phone model.
For 7941/7961 you must hold # key on keypad for 5 or more seconds immediately after power on. When phone starts blinking like christmas tree,
enter 123456789*0# on phone keypad to complete reset. Phone will try to download your modified firmware from TFTP.
You can also try to modify .loads files, forcing phone to load firmware file with name different from original one.
